    "# The AI Clinical Trials Architect: A Self-Evolving Agent Guild for Multi-Objective RAG Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 0: The Grand Challenge: Automating Clinical Trial Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1. The New Frontier: From Answering Questions to Generating Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a deep dive into the next generation of agentic systems. In previous explorations, we've seen AI systems that can answer questions or summarize documents. Today, we elevate our ambitions significantly. Our goal is to build an AI system that can tackle a core, high-value task in the biopharmaceutical industry: **drafting the \"Patient Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\" for a new clinical trial.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is orders of magnitude more complex than simple RAG. It involves synthesizing information from disparate sources (medical literature, regulatory law, population data), understanding complex trade-offs, and generating a structured, compliant, and feasible document. It is a perfect testbed for a truly intelligent, multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2. The Multi-Objective Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful clinical trial isn't just scientifically sound; it's a delicate balance of competing priorities. Our AI system must learn to navigate this complex, multi-dimensional trade-off space. We will not be optimizing for a single score, but for a **Pareto Frontier** across five pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Scientific Rigor:** How well do the criteria isolate the target patient population based on the latest medical research?\n",
    "2.  **Regulatory Compliance:** Do the criteria adhere to FDA guidelines and established legal precedents?\n",
    "3.  **Ethical Soundness:** Are vulnerable populations appropriately protected? Is the trial design fair and just?\n",
    "4.  **Recruitment Feasibility:** Can a hospital realistically find enough patients who meet these criteria based on real-world population data?\n",
    "5.  **Operational Simplicity (Cost Proxy):** Are the screening procedures required by the criteria simple and inexpensive, or do they require complex, costly tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3. The Architectural Vision: A Hierarchical Agent-of-Agents System\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we will build a hierarchical system:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Inner Loop (The \"Trial Design Guild\"):** A collaborative team of specialist agents built with LangGraph. This guild is our advanced RAG pipeline. It takes a trial concept and drafts a single criteria document.\n",
    "-   **The Outer Loop (The \"AI Research Director\"):** A supervisory agent system, also built with LangGraph. It acts as the manager, observing the Guild's performance across all five objectives. It then intelligently evolves the Guild's internal \"Standard Operating Procedures\" (SOPs) — its configurations, tools, and prompts — to continuously improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.4. Visual Blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Image of the Hierarchical System Diagram will be placed here -->\n",
    "\n",

The criteria must be designed to select a population that is most likely to benefit and least likely to be harmed by the intervention. The risks to subjects must be reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.\n",

    "3. Justice: This principle concerns the fairness of distribution of the burdens and benefits of research. The selection of research subjects must be equitable. Criteria should not be designed to exclude certain groups without a sound scientific or safety-related justification. For example, excluding participants based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status is unjust unless there is a clear rationale related to the drug's mechanism or risk profile.\n",

    "1.  **Get Access:** Go to the [MIMIC-III PhysioNet page](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) and follow the instructions to become a credentialed user. This is a required step for ethical and legal access to the data.\n",
    "2.  **Download from Kaggle:** Once you have access, you can download the dataset from official sources or from [MIMIC-III Dataset page](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/). You will need to download the following three files:\n",
    "    -   `PATIENTS.csv.gz`\n",
    "    -   `DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv.gz`\n",
    "    -   `LABEVENTS.csv.gz`\n",
    "3.  **Place the Files:** Create a directory `mimiciii_csvs` inside your `./data/mimic_db/` folder. Place the three downloaded `.csv.gz` files into this new directory. Your file structure should look like this:\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "The next cell will check for these files, and if found, will load them into a highly efficient DuckDB database. **Note:** Loading `LABEVENTS.csv.gz` can take several minutes and consume significant RAM due to its size (>250 million rows)."
