      "overall_risk_profile": "The patient's biomarker results indicate a high risk profile for diabetes, with both glucose and HbA1c levels exceeding normal ranges. The most concerning findings are the elevated glucose level of 140.0 mg/dL and HbA1c level of 7.5%, which suggest impaired glucose regulation. These results align with the predicted disease of diabetes, supporting the likelihood of an underlying diabetic condition.",
      "narrative": "Based on your test results, it's likely that you may have diabetes, with our system showing an 85% confidence level in this prediction. Your glucose and HbA1c levels, which are important indicators of blood sugar control, are higher than normal, suggesting that your body may be having trouble regulating its blood sugar levels. I want to emphasize that it's essential to discuss these results with your doctor, who can provide a definitive diagnosis and guidance on the best course of action. Please know that while these results may be concerning, many people with diabetes are able to manage their condition and lead healthy, active lives with the right treatment and support."
